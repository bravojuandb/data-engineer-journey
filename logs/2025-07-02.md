## Log for today 2025-07-02

t’s been a few days since my last log, but I haven’t missed a single day of my routine.

This is my second week following a structured weekly rhythm that allows me to keep multiple learning fronts active:
	•	Monday: Python Fluency (2h)
	•	Tuesday: Crash Course (1h) + SQL (1h)
	•	Wednesday: SQL (2h)
	•	Thursday: Project Work (2h)
	•	Friday: Python Fluency (2h)
	•	Saturday: DataCamp (2h)
	•	Sunday: Project (1h) + DataCamp (1h)

Today, Wednesday, I focused entirely on SQL. I created a new PostgreSQL database and schema with one fact table and four dimension tables — a simple star schema.

This setup is part of my power-sql-drills repository, which I use to train SQL queries on a regular basis.
