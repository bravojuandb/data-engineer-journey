## Log for today July 17

After six months of steady study, I begin to feel the fatigue.

This was my third week following a weekly rythm that felt more like juggling. 

I am shifting to a more simplified strategy: I reduced my open fronts from five to three,

Python drills, Project completion, and SQL drills.

I polished my Notion planner in the sape of this new plan.




I am happy to be learning so many things, but it is time to go deeper into the 
most important ones.
