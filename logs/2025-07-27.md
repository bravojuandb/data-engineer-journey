## Log for today, July 27, 2025

Today was a beautiful and fruitful Sunday — the tenth day of my new weekly rhythm.
I’m starting to feel at home working within just three core fields: Python, Projects, and SQL.

- This morning, I completed a Python daily drill focused on grouping words by length — a satisfying little challenge.
- I studied Python data structures for 15 focused minutes.
- I also solved one LeetCode exercise in Python and made it halfway through another of medium difficulty.
- Finally, I made steady, even joyful, progress in a DataCamp course on Python functions.


## Let this be the quote for now on.

From The Didascalicon by Hugh of Saint Victor:

“Multi multa naturaliter sciunt, 
sed quia negligentia desides sunt, 
non excolunt quod sciunt, 
nec prodesse sibi sciunt. 
lii vix aut nihil naturaliter sciunt, 
sed quia sunt studiosi, 
diligentia student, 
et inde proficiunt. 
Illi habent unde prosint et non prosunt, 
isti non habent unde prosint et prosunt.”


“Many know much by nature, 
but because they are lazy through negligence, 
they do not cultivate what they know, 
nor do they know how to benefit from it. 
Others know little or nothing by nature, 
but because they are diligent, 
they apply themselves through effort, 
and so they make progress. 
The former have the means to benefit and do not; 
the latter lack the means but do benefit.”
