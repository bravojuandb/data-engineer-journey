Week 3 of Weekly Rhythm

1. Overview

I am entering the third week of my optimized weekly study rhythm. My focus areas remain consistent:
	•	Python Drills (Pillar 1: Fluency and Logic)
	•	SQL Drills (LeetCode exercises)
	•	ClassicBook ETL Pipeline (project work)

2. Key Progress Made
	•	Continued working through Python drills, focusing on medium and hard-level exercises.
	•	Advanced in LeetCode SQL problems, especially on filtering and joins.
	•	Made significant progress on the ClassicBook ETL pipeline:
	•	Dedicated nine hours on Wednesday to polish the pipeline
	•	Wrote and reviewed my CV
	•	Polished GitHub, LinkedIn, and DataCamp profiles
	•	Submitted my first job application

3. Reflection

The application deadline provided a strong push to finalize parts of my pipeline and improve my public-facing materials. However, the workload on Wednesday was intense and disrupted my consistency in the following days.

4. Focus for Week 3

Main Objectives:
	•	Resume daily rhythm and recover consistency
	•	Drill Python (2 hard + 1 review drill per session)
	•	Continue solving LeetCode SQL problems
	•	Set up final steps of the ClassicBook ETL pipeline before loading into SQL

Secondary Objective:
	•	Address retry drills from previous weeks

## Short note in the afternoon.

Today I felt unmotivated, but here's what I did anyway:

- Reviewed 8 Practice Sections from DataCamp (SQL, Python, Docker)
- Completed an assesment test on general Python programming.
- Explored the OpenAI API, and jad the first thought to implement it in one of my projects.
